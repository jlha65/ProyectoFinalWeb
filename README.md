# Final project for Web Development Course
This is a webpage source code for a web application called AdoptMe.

## Main objective
The goal of our web application was to create a service where you can register/log in and either place pets you can't take care of anymore on adoption or adopt such pets from other people using the same service. The idea is for the user to register a pet using their basic data (name, animal type, race, etc.), then someone else looks at your pet and decides to adopt it, so they contact you with the contact info registered on the profile linked to the pet.

## Process of development
The project was made by me and [Luisa Pineda](https://github.com/luisapineda). We used VS Code with the VS Live Share plugin to collaborate and work in the same machine. That plugin only allows changes to be made on one machine, since the one that connects does not possess the files. (Disclaimer: That's why I have no commits with code, as all the working code was located in Luisa's machine.) Also, we had a lot of doubts about PHP. (Such as how why can't we include a PHP file more than two times in different files? it worked with two but not three?)
